# Noughts and Crosses
This program includes four different AI's to play Noughts and Crosses: MENACE, Q-learning, minimax and negamax. MENACE stands for Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine and is one of the firstly developed machine learning algorithms. Q-learning is a more modern algorithm. The game can also be played by humans and with a random player.

## Documentation
An extensive Javadoc documentation can be found [here](https://borroot.github.io/noughts-and-crosses/). 

## Paper
I also wrote a paper about this project which can be found [here](misc/paper/Menace_and_Q-learning.pdf).

## Plots
I used two scripts to generate plots for the paper from the results of multiple training sessions. The scripts can be found [here](misc/plots/).
